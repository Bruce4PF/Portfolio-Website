# Snowed In: A Day in London, Ontario  

Last night, London, Ontario was hit by one of the biggest snowstorms I’ve ever seen. By the time I woke up, my backyard door was covered in 2 feet of snow, and could barely see outside. The little table in my backyard is about to snap from the sheer weight of the snow on top of it.

## The Struggles of Being Snowed In  

It didn’t take long to realize that leaving the house wasn’t an option. The driveway? Completely snowed in. The sidewalks? Gone. Even opening my front door was a challenge because of the snow drift that had piled up against it.  

There’s a certain helplessness that comes with being trapped by snow. Classes for the day? Cancelled. You had plans? Not happening. The city is basically in survival mode, and you’re left with no choice but to hunker down and wait it out.  

## Finding the Silver Lining  

But here’s the thing—there’s also something magical about being snowed in. It’s like nature is forcing you to pause, slow down, and embrace the chaos.  

This morning, I made 3 days worth of food, caught up on chores, and went back to bed to sleep in a little more. The world feels quieter when it’s covered in snow, like it’s taking a deep breath. Sure, I’m annoyed that I can’t get to school and see my friends, but I’m also kind of grateful for the unexpected break from the usual hustle.  

## The Challenges Ahead  

Of course, there’s still the looming reality of digging out. At some point, I’m going to have to face the mountain of snow that is my driveway. Shoveling is no joke when the snow is this deep—it’s less of a chore and more of a full-body workout.  

And for the next few weeks commuting to my campus buildings and around town will be hell. Slippery streets, wet socks, and drivers who think 4WD makes them invincible.  

## Grateful for the Little Things  

Despite the inconvenience, I’m reminded of how resilient we are when faced with situations like this. My neighbors are making snowmen right now, people snow drifting on the cul-de-sac outside, and the infamous snowboarder being dragged by the car—we all find our ways to thrive in the storm.
