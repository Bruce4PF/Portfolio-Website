## Summary
The **Metal Defect Classifier** is a machine learning project designed to automate the detection and classification of defects on metal surfaces. By leveraging deep learning and image processing techniques, this solution enhances quality assurance processes in manufacturing industries, reducing manual inspection errors and saving time.

## Key Highlights

- **Purpose**: To identify and classify defects such as scratches, dents, and cracks on metal surfaces.
- **Approach**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a diverse dataset of metal surface images.
- **Impact**: Accelerates the defect detection process, ensures consistency in quality control, and reduces production waste.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Images of metal surfaces with labeled defect categories (scratches, dents, cracks, etc.).
- Data augmentation techniques applied to improve model generalizability.

### Step 2: Preprocessing
- Normalization and resizing of images.
- Augmented training data with rotation, flipping, and scaling for robustness.

### Step 3: Model Development
- A custom CNN architecture was used to classify defects into multiple categories.
- The model was fine-tuned using transfer learning from a pre-trained ResNet50 model.

### Step 4: Evaluation
- Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall were used to evaluate model performance.
- Extensive validation to ensure high accuracy and low false positive rates.

## Results

- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved 90% on the test set.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Average inference time \<100ms per image.
- **Robust Classification**: High precision and recall across all defect categories.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
