## Overview

ChuckleChallenge.com is a take on the classic "Try Not to Laugh" challenge made famous on YouTube. The platform streams curated YouTube videos to users while a deep learning model analyzes their facial expressions, detecting laughter and introducing an automated accountability element to the game.

## Key Features

- **Video Search**: Allows the user to search for videos to use for the game
- **Random Video**: Selects a random funny video for the user to play with
- **Computer Vision**: Tracks the user's facial expressions, ending the game and timer if it detects the user has laughed, up to an 84% accuracy rate

## Technologies Used

- **React and Next.js**: For building a fast and responsive front-end interface
- **Node.js**: To power a robust back-end that supports data processing
- **Kaggle, Python and TensorFlow**: Used to configure the CNN model and preprocessing data augmentation
- **AWS EC2**: Provides cloud computing to run the CNN model
- **Flask and Nginx**: Handles cross-communication between platforms, rerouting on a reverse proxy server
- **Vercel**: Hosts the web application and enables Next.js
- **Chakra UI and Framer**: To make beautiful components and animations

## Challenges and Learnings

I had to learn every technology used from scratch, all previously unknown to me. A mind-boggling amount of time was spent on intro documentation and tutorial vidoes. From end-to-end, I learned to make and configure CNN models, front-end development, cross-platform communication, how to deploy to AWS and Vercel, domain management, and much more.

## Outcome

To date, ChuckleChallenge.com has captured 8000+ visitors, showing players how AI can affect the gaming industry. Inspired by the surge of AI when ChatGPT first came out, ChuckleChallenge was created to capitalize on this emerging technology, and show how it could be used in different contexts.
