## What is IPS?
Ivey Product Society (IPS) is a student run club with the mission of making Ivey and Western the top product management school in Canada.
We focus on developing product thinking in our students, bringing exposure to the role, and kickstarting their careers in product.

Originally started in 2020 by Matthew Woo (HBA 2012) and Mary Yao (HBA 2013), they hosted a yearly Product Fellowship Bootcamp, 
an intensive bootcamp that teaches the fundamentals of product management. Since then, it's been turned into a 4th year course 
taught by themselves at Ivey. 

However, we recognized a lack of a community in PM, so in 2023, myself and a handful of students decided to formally create Ivey Product Society as a student club. 
We've now expanded to hosting educational workshops, case competitions, career resources, and more, bringing in-person PMs from FAANG and more.
We continue to run the Fellowship Bootcamp in addition to the course, creating this community of product-minded people.

## My Work as Co-President
- Leading team of 23 executives
- Directing vision and operations of the club
- Fostering a truly engaging and inclusive culture
- Teaching what PM is and helping students kickstart their careers

This club is something I'm deeply passionate about; building this community and spreading the product mindset has proven truly fulfilling.
I've made some of my closest friends through this, and have learned much about myself as a leader and product manager.
